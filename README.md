# mathematical-logic-notes

This collection of notes is considered a Work In Progress
The current up-to-date version of the notes can be found at https://github.com/mkfifo/mathematical-logic-notes


The text covered by these notes is ``Mathematical Logic'' by Ian Chriswell and Wilfred Hodges,
Published by Oxford logic, Oxfored texts in logic 3.

The pusposes of these notes is in no way to serve as a substitute for the text.

When reading through the text I was often annoyed at the lack of complete solutions - many are ommitted.


I am writing these notes as a collection of all my fully worked answers, along with some minor additions that I found useful
along the way.

There may be some exercises missing, some of the earlier examples seemed too trivial / boring - these should be very few
and any PRs to include them are welcome.
